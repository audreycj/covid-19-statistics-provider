Requirements:
- Search Bar for Country
- Confirmed cases
- Active Cases
- Recovered
- Deaths

Notes: 
- You will be given complete creative control for this.
- Design should be clean, formal, and official looking. 
- This is a serious matter so the feel of the site should not include any joking matters or the 'advertisement' feel. 

Additional points may be awarded if you get to add more essential data about the pandemic.
